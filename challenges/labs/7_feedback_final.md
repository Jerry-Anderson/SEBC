Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?

The boot camp was very useful.  I would definitely recommend it to others. As far as the level of difficulty, I thought it was the proper level for the expected attendees.  It was a ciriculum designed for problem solvers. 

Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
My most unfamiliar topic was testing HDFS.  Before the class, I had limited experience.  I was most familiar with installing the cluster itself.

Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
I enjoyed the kerberos and Sentry discussions. Security is definitely the most helpful. I don't think any of the topics would be considered not useful.

How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?  I feel comfortable enough to install a production cluster.  Completing the class provided the confidence.
